# Getting started with TI TM4C123GXL LaunchPad
In the past months I took this free online MOOC course: Embedded Systems – Shape the World (https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-utaustinx-ut-6-02x#.VKEHvf_n3Y8). This course is really recommended for those, who want to getting started with ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. 

In this repository some demo projects about how to program TI TM4C123GXL LaunchPad are created. The detail description about these projects can be found in my blog: https://filderbaer.wordpress.com/ 

## Some notes about demo projects
* GPIO_Demo: GPIO programming, LED and Switch interfacing

* PLL_SysTick_Demo: Phase-Lock-Loop configuration, system tick timer programming
* UART_Bluetooth_HC06: UART programming
